### Projects
#### Muti Tier Orchestrator (MTO) (1.5 years)
**Reduce Latency and CPU usage** of 5G inner components. Research and development project finished both with an implementation as a proof of concept and a research article presented at ICIN2020 conference (find [published article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9059546) at IEEE biblioteca).
Module developed in Python backed with a MongoDB. API Service inside MTO ready to integrate with clients. API Client definition both in Java and Python.

#### Acoustic Calculator (0.5 years)
Software development of **sound propagation within an enclosed space**. Several technical issues tackled together with acoustic engineers in order to define an accurate model. Integration of module with 3D renderisation company in order to have a more visual ouptut.

#### Chanchus (1.5 years)
WebScraper that would trigger alarm when finding profitable operations with online sport betting. Main objective was to **subsidize university** and get started with non-academic development of software.
