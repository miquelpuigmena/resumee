### Project Description
#### Muti Tier Orchestrator
**Reduce Latency and CPU usage** of 5G inner components. Research and development project finished both with an implementation as a proof of concept and a research article presented at ICIN2020 conference (find [published article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9059546) at IEEE biblioteca).
Module developed in Python backed with a MongoDB. API Service inside MTO ready to integrate with clients. API Client definition both in Java and Python.

#### Acoustic Calculator 
Software development of **sound propagation within an enclosed space**. Several technical issues tackled together with acoustic engineers in order to define an accurate model. Integration of module with 3D renderisation company in order to have a more visual ouptut.

#### Chanchus 
WebScraper that would trigger alarm when finding profitable operations with online sport betting. Main objective was to **subsidize university** and get started with non-academic development of software.

#### ESP32 Sniffer
Beacon Synch project implements on ESP32 board a beacon Sniffer that updates an internal timer on tick scale. Each beacon sniffed is decoupled on ieee80211 structs. Find Github project repo [here](https://github.com/miquelpuigmena/ESP32sniffer).

#### Graduate program
Joined Nuuday's graduate program. Implementing microservices written in Java hosted on AWS Kubernetes (EKS) and deployed with Terraform.
